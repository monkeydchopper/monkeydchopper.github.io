<li>agree</li>
<li>many characteristics, which leads to leadership, are innate. Such as extrem confidence in his idea, strong sense of control. Many people just cannot learn that.(Jobs and Wozniak, Larry Ellison)</li>
<li>Other characteristics, like intellectual quotient, the ability of fast learning, is hard for one to learn or immitate.</li>
<li>Common people can practice very hard to be a great leader, but not as prominent as those inborn leaders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="My-Answer"><a href="#My-Answer" class="headerlink" title="My Answer"></a>My Answer</h3><p>　　Throughout history, there are lots of great leaders who make a great change to people’s living. In acient times, there are Alexander the Great, George Washington, Chairman Mao, etc. Nowadays, there is also a group of leaders, distributing in politics, acdemics and business areas, who are influencing our living, making the world a better place. Some argue that their chrisma is native and can’t be taught or learnt. I take the same idea with those people for following reasons.<br>　　From my perspective, many characterisrics leading to leasership, are innate. Such as extrem confidence in his or her ideas and a strong sense of control. In recent years, many people would consider Steve Jobs to be the best leader in the field of technology, so I’ll take him as an example. Dropping out from university, starting his own company with no money and no funding in his parent’s garage, being fired by his own company, setting up Pixel to compete against Apple he used to own, all these stuffs show us a people who shows extrodinarily confidence in his own believing and is extremely competitive. According to some people who are familiar with him like his ex-wife, he is a people with many drawbacks, he didn’t care much about her and their child and showed arrogance. If I take all the characteristics above as contributing factors to the whole profile of Jobs, as far as I can see, he is a kinda crazy man. His arrogance, persistence and high competitiveness is hard to imitate or learn.<br>　　There are also many other characteristics that contribute to leadership, for example, decisiveness, which many people lacks of, and the ability to learn something swiftly, which demands a high IQ. Market is changing constantly, great leaders should have the ability to predict the market and dominant it. These abilities can’t be trained or there will be a lot more numbers of great leaders than today.<br>　　However, there’s also a lot of people who can practice very hard to be a leader of high level. I would consider Sergay Brin to be people of this kind. He builds his company step by step, with a precise goal of making things cool, till the Alphabet of this day. Maybe he is less chrismatic, but anyway, he becomes a good leader.<br>　　To out it into the nutshell, common people can practice industriously to become a great leader, but not as prominent as those inborn leaders.</p>

<li>elderly people are always stubborn in what they believe.</li>

<h3 id="My-Answer"><a href="#My-Answer" class="headerlink" title="My Answer"></a>My Answer</h3><p>　　The world has changed a lot during the past 50 years,the internet permeate into everybodys’ life, we have easier access to various suggesions of different kinds of people. Under this circumstances, many argue that our grandparents advices are of no value due to the out-dated ideas. I partly support the idea and I will discuss it in the following paragraph.<br>　　To my mind, people’s opinions are limited by their cognition, many elderly people, especially in China, are poorly educated due to the ratherly poor educational infrastructure of the past century. Part of them even think what children should do is not being educated but stay home and help adults with housework. many elders in China still believe in feudalism like patriarchy which suffers the youth a lot. Those partial ideology strougly contradicts to the society today which emphasizes on everyone having the same right to pursue their dream and liberty. So I really don’t think people should listen to advices of that kind from the elders.<br>　　There is an old saying goes,” With age comes wisdom and experience.” But that kind of accumulation also has a adverse effect on people for it makes people stongly believe in what their experience and stubborn in what they believe. In this era of information explotion, people fall behind if they insist on dewelling in the past and not assimilate new things. Take my high school English teacher, who is a sagacious old man, as an example. English grammar has changed consistantly over time, but as our teacher is an authoritative sepecialist in English, he feels extremely uncomfortable about the changes, which he deeply believes to be harmful to the elegance and preciseness of English. So he just considers them wrong and get mad at us by calling us old diehard if we insist on using the new grammar. It’s quite sarcastic but sad when he called us old diehard, because this is exactly what we think of him. It might be quite controversial whether the newborn things are better or not. But to me, the progress of the society is irreversible, what we should do is not confront it in the face but focus on its advantageous side and learn to accept it. people wisdom like my English teacher can be obstinate, so I really doubt if elders’ ideas can be helpful to us to get a better development.　　<br>　　After these long doubtfulness towards elders, I have to commit that, sometimes, advices from elders can be of great importance because many high morals remained unchanged during the time. For instance, when I got into college, My grandma asked me about my mojor. After knowing that she can’t offer any advices on my course, she told me,” China is a nation distinguished for its dilligence, which is the reason why we thrived for thousands of years and kept being a main character of the world. So my darling, keep studying, keep working, your industrious quality won’t fail you.” I was so impressed by her word that even today I take it as an stimulation.<br>　　To put it into a nutshell, advices from the old like your grandparents are usually not as insightful as the past for their stereotype and limited cognition, but there are also many morals they have been keeping still remained valuable throughout the time. People like us really need to skim the scream and absorb the quintessence.</p>

<li>totally disagree</li>
<li>user experience is more important<br>1.quality of the product. If the product is perfect, the initial users will advertise it by word of mouth<br>2.If the product is terrible, no matter how you advertise it, people will just take it as a joke rather than use it.  </li>
<li>Hiring employees of high quality</li>
<li>concession: advertisement is important in branding a company name, making it well-known, but the core compatitiveness of a company is the product, businesses should make sure the product is good before put more money in advertising.  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="My-Answer"><a href="#My-Answer" class="headerlink" title="My Answer"></a>My Answer</h3><p>　　In this era of information explosion, people are inundated with various kinds of advertisements.Advertising seems to become a prerequisite for a company to thrive. Under this circumstances, some people argue that entrepreneur and businessman should invest more money into advertising to make their own brand well-known by people, thus make more profit out of it. I totally disagree with the statement for the following reasons.<br>　　In my opinion, advertising is just a tool whose function is spreading out value, but what virtually makes value is the product itself. If a company does not focus on providing a better user experience, no matter how delecate or attractive the advertisement is, people will not use it. In China, there’s a lot of web game company, who makes great effort on hiring celebrities to endorse the game, and the advertisement does receive lots of attention at first, but when people finally find out that the game filled with predictable plot and disturbing graphs, nobody ever play it anymore. Some of these game has even become a representitve of crappy games. Conversely, if a company put a lot money into optimizing their product and offering best user experience to their customers, the initial customers will take the role of salespeople and advertise it to their friends and families by word of mouth. Take my experience as an example, my friend once introduced me of a vedio website “bilibili”, after one time of experience, I was totally struck by its pithy style, free of advertisement and fast video loading velocity. So I began to introduce it to all of my friend who had not used it before. By now, most of my freinds use this website to watch animations.<br>　　There’s another important factor which I rank before advertising is the quality of employees. Just as Bill Gates once said,” Let me bring 100 employees of my company, I can rebuid a Microsoft.” A group of highly innovative people can always come up with valuable ideas which help the company get through the dark time and lead the way to success. A group of people with low efficiency and less enthusiasm for work can lead to a bad working environment, which will cause a loss in productivity and finally cost the profit of the company.<br>  Though there are several points I would list before advertising , it cannot be denied that advertising is also of great importance. Good advertisement drawing a lot attention from the public can make a fortune for the company. But without a good team and high quality product that matches the ad, the company cannot success anyhow.<br>  To put it into a nutshell, advertisement is important in branding a company name, making it well-known, but the core compatitiveness of a company is the product, businesses should make sure the product is good before put more money in advertising.  </p>
