<h3 id="My-Answer"><a href="#My-Answer" class="headerlink" title="My Answer"></a>My Answer</h3><p>　　The world has changed a lot during the past 50 years,the internet permeate into everybodys’ life, we have easier access to various suggesions of different kinds of people. Under this circumstances, many argue that our grandparents advices are of no value due to the out-dated ideas. I partly support the idea and I will discuss it in the following paragraph.<br>　　To my mind, people’s opinions are limited by their cognition, many elderly people, especially in China, are poorly educated due to the ratherly poor educational infrastructure of the past century. Part of them even think what children should do is not being educated but stay home and help adults with housework. many elders in China still believe in feudalism like patriarchy which suffers the youth a lot. Those partial ideology strougly contradicts to the society today which emphasizes on everyone having the same right to pursue their dream and liberty. So I really don’t think people should listen to advices of that kind from the elders.<br>　　There is an old saying goes,” With age comes wisdom and experience.” But that kind of accumulation also has a adverse effect on people for it makes people stongly believe in what their experience and stubborn in what they believe. In this era of information explotion, people fall behind if they insist on dewelling in the past and not assimilate new things. Take my high school English teacher, who is a sagacious old man, as an example. English grammar has changed consistantly over time, but as our teacher is an authoritative sepecialist in English, he feels extremely uncomfortable about the changes, which he deeply believes to be harmful to the elegance and preciseness of English. So he just considers them wrong and get mad at us by calling us old diehard if we insist on using the new grammar. It’s quite sarcastic but sad when he called us old diehard, because this is exactly what we think of him. It might be quite controversial whether the newborn things are better or not. But to me, the progress of the society is irreversible, what we should do is not confront it in the face but focus on its advantageous side and learn to accept it. people wisdom like my English teacher can be obstinate, so I really doubt if elders’ ideas can be helpful to us to get a better development.　　<br>　　After these long doubtfulness towards elders, I have to commit that, sometimes, advices from elders can be of great importance because many high morals remained unchanged during the time. For instance, when I got into college, My grandma asked me about my mojor. After knowing that she can’t offer any advices on my course, she told me,” China is a nation distinguished for its dilligence, which is the reason why we thrived for thousands of years and kept being a main character of the world. So my darling, keep studying, keep working, your industrious quality won’t fail you.” I was so impressed by her word that even today I take it as an stimulation.<br>　　To put it into a nutshell, advices from the old like your grandparents are usually not as insightful as the past for their stereotype and limited cognition, but there are also many morals they have been keeping still remained valuable throughout the time. People like us really need to skim the scream and absorb the quintessence.</p>
