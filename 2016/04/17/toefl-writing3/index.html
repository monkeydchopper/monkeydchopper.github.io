<li>many characteristics, which leads to leadership, are innate. Such as extrem confidence in his idea, strong sense of control. Many people just cannot learn that.(Jobs and Wozniak, Larry Ellison)</li>
<li>Other characteristics, like intellectual quotient, the ability of fast learning, is hard for one to learn or immitate.</li>
<li>Common people can practice very hard to be a great leader, but not as prominent as those inborn leaders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="My-Answer"><a href="#My-Answer" class="headerlink" title="My Answer"></a>My Answer</h3><p>　　Throughout history, there are lots of great leaders who make a great change to people’s living. In acient times, there are Alexander the Great, George Washington, Chairman Mao, etc. Nowadays, there is also a group of leaders, distributing in politics, acdemics and business areas, who are influencing our living, making the world a better place. Some argue that their chrisma is native and can’t be taught or learnt. I take the same idea with those people for following reasons.<br>　　From my perspective, many characterisrics leading to leasership, are innate. Such as extrem confidence in his or her ideas and a strong sense of control. In recent years, many people would consider Steve Jobs to be the best leader in the field of technology, so I’ll take him as an example. Dropping out from university, starting his own company with no money and no funding in his parent’s garage, being fired by his own company, setting up Pixel to compete against Apple he used to own, all these stuffs show us a people who shows extrodinarily confidence in his own believing and is extremely competitive. According to some people who are familiar with him like his ex-wife, he is a people with many drawbacks, he didn’t care much about her and their child and showed arrogance. If I take all the characteristics above as contributing factors to the whole profile of Jobs, as far as I can see, he is a kinda crazy man. His arrogance, persistence and high competitiveness is hard to imitate or learn.<br>　　There are also many other characteristics that contribute to leadership, for example, decisiveness, which many people lacks of, and the ability to learn something swiftly, which demands a high IQ. Market is changing constantly, great leaders should have the ability to predict the market and dominant it. These abilities can’t be trained or there will be a lot more numbers of great leaders than today.<br>　　However, there’s also a lot of people who can practice very hard to be a leader of high level. I would consider Sergay Brin to be people of this kind. He builds his company step by step, with a precise goal of making things cool, till the Alphabet of this day. Maybe he is less chrismatic, but anyway, he becomes a good leader.<br>　　To out it into the nutshell, common people can practice industriously to become a great leader, but not as prominent as those inborn leaders.</p>
