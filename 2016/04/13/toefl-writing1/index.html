<h3 id="My-Answer"><a href="#My-Answer" class="headerlink" title="My Answer"></a>My Answer</h3><p>　　In this era of information explosion, people are inundated with various kinds of advertisements.Advertising seems to become a prerequisite for a company to thrive. Under this circumstances, some people argue that entrepreneur and businessman should invest more money into advertising to make their own brand well-known by people, thus make more profit out of it. I totally disagree with the statement for the following reasons.<br>　　In my opinion, advertising is just a tool whose function is spreading out value, but what virtually makes value is the product itself. If a company does not focus on providing a better user experience, no matter how delecate or attractive the advertisement is, people will not use it. In China, there’s a lot of web game company, who makes great effort on hiring celebrities to endorse the game, and the advertisement does receive lots of attention at first, but when people finally find out that the game filled with predictable plot and disturbing graphs, nobody ever play it anymore. Some of these game has even become a representitve of crappy games. Conversely, if a company put a lot money into optimizing their product and offering best user experience to their customers, the initial customers will take the role of salespeople and advertise it to their friends and families by word of mouth. Take my experience as an example, my friend once introduced me of a vedio website “bilibili”, after one time of experience, I was totally struck by its pithy style, free of advertisement and fast video loading velocity. So I began to introduce it to all of my friend who had not used it before. By now, most of my freinds use this website to watch animations.<br>　　There’s another important factor which I rank before advertising is the quality of employees. Just as Bill Gates once said,” Let me bring 100 employees of my company, I can rebuid a Microsoft.” A group of highly innovative people can always come up with valuable ideas which help the company get through the dark time and lead the way to success. A group of people with low efficiency and less enthusiasm for work can lead to a bad working environment, which will cause a loss in productivity and finally cost the profit of the company.<br>  Though there are several points I would list before advertising , it cannot be denied that advertising is also of great importance. Good advertisement drawing a lot attention from the public can make a fortune for the company. But without a good team and high quality product that matches the ad, the company cannot success anyhow.<br>  To put it into a nutshell, advertisement is important in branding a company name, making it well-known, but the core compatitiveness of a company is the product, businesses should make sure the product is good before put more money in advertising.  </p>
